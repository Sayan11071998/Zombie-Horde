🚀 Project Completed: Zombie Horde 🚀

Remember when I thought creating a basic shooter game would be a "quick" weekend project? Yeah, neither do I. 😅 But after countless late-night coding sessions, debugging enemy AI that sometimes seemed smarter than me, and wrestling with Unreal Engine's Blueprints, I’m thrilled to finally share Zombie Survival with you!

This project has been a massive leap for me in 3D game development, pushing my skills in Blueprints, AI systems, and overall gameplay mechanics to the next level.

Here are some of the highlights:
🔥 First-Person Shooting: Engage in fast-paced combat with a fully functional AR gun system (because who doesn't love a good shootout with the undead?).
🧟‍♂️ Wave-Based Enemy Spawning: Enemies just keep coming, one wave after another, because apparently, zombies don’t need breaks. 
🧠 Advanced Enemy AI: Enemies dynamically react to your presence, coordinating attacks like they attended a strategy meeting before dinner.
💥 Health & Damage System: Tactical gameplay with health points for both players and enemies—because it's no fun if the zombies just go down after one hit, right?
🎯 Gun Mechanics: Automatic bullet effects and a reload system—nothing feels better than a well-timed reload when you're surrounded!
💀 Kill Counter & Health Widget: For those of us who need to keep score and brag about how many zombies we’ve eliminated!

Key Learnings:
- 🕹️ Mastered core gameplay mechanics with Blueprints for character movement and interactions.
- 🎥 Implemented smooth animations for both player and enemy actions (because even zombies deserve smooth movement).
- 🧠 Developed an advanced AI system for enemy behavior, making sure those zombies keep me on my toes.
- 🔫 Built a gun-firing system with automatic bullet effects and reloading (no bullets left? Good luck!).
- 🏃‍♂️ Created sprint and jump mechanics for advanced player movement—because sometimes, you just need to run faster than the zombies.

It’s been a wild, sleepless, frustrating, and incredibly fulfilling journey. I’ve learned so much from this project, and I can’t wait to apply these skills to even bigger challenges.
